# Lecture 1

Challenge
- Try different values for k (passed to the KNeighborsClassifier constructor)- What can you achieve for MNIST and CIFAR-10?
- Visualize some of the errors (image, ground truth, predicted)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus: 
- Try different metrics (passed to the KNeighborsClassifier constructor)
- Try extracting features by decomposing the images with PCA (sklearn

----------------------------------------------------------------

Results by using KNN and PCA, and data reduction by a factor of 1/6:
- MNIST results : 0.9517
- CIFAR10 results : 0.2889
